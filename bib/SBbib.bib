  abstract = {The context of this work is vision-based motion planning for humanoid
	robots in an unknown environment. We present an efficient combination
	of on-line 3D environment modeling and motion planning methods for
	humanoid robots (e.g whole body motion and walking ) in non-static
	environment. To construct the model of the environment, we rely on
	3D occupancy grid that is updated incrementally by stereo vision.
	As the dimension of configuration space is high for humanoid robots,
	a roadmap based method is used for motion planning. However, as the
	environment is not static, it is necessary to update the roadmap
	after receiving new visual information. In other words, the nodes
	and edges which are in collision, based on the new update of the
	environment, must be erased. Moreover, preliminary steps are necessary
	for considering the environment as a non-static model. As we construct
	the model incrementally by vision, several thousands points would
	appear in each update of the model. Therefore, updating the roadmap
	raises algorithmic complexity issues. Our approach is an extension
	of a recent idea to cope with the problem. After presenting the approach,
	we implement our method by planning a collision-free motion in a
	3D occupancy grid model generated by HRP2 based on stereo vision.
	As the robot navigates in the environment, it receives updated information
	through its on-board cameras and refreshes the 3D model of the environment
	incrementally. Conventionally, the 3D model can be composed of up
	to millions of voxel. If the statuses of some voxels change, our
	method uses these changes to update the last roadmap locally. This
	updated roadmap is then reused for further motion planning. We evaluate
	our algorithm by measuring processing time and memory usage in each
	step and compare them with its descendant.},

  abstract = {A fast but nevertheless accurate approach for surface extraction from
	noisy 3D point clouds is presented. It consists of two parts, namely
	a plane fitting and a polygonalization step. Both exploit the sequential
	nature of 3D data acquisition on mobile robots in form of range images.
	For the plane fitting, this is used to revise the standard mathematical
	formulation to an incremental version, which allows a linear computation.
	For the polygonalization, the neighborhood relation in range images
	is exploited. Experiments are presented using a time-of-flight range
	camera in form of a Swissranger SR-3000. Results include lab scenes
	as well as data from two runs of the rescue robot league at the RoboCup
	German Open 2007 with 1,414, respectively 2,343 sensor snapshots.
	The 36ldr106, respectively 59ldr106 points from the two point clouds
	are reduced to about 14ldr103, respectively 23ldr103 planes with
	only about 0.2 sec of total computation time per snapshot while the
	robot moves along. Uncertainty analysis of the computed plane parameters
	is presented as well.},

  abstract = {In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes
	in unorganized point clouds. The algorithm decomposes the point cloud
	into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of
	remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set
	of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and
	detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with
	surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we
	automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape
	proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the
	presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed
	method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud
	and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point
	sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within
	less than a minute. Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple
	and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical
	parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering,
	shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and
	reverse engineering.},
