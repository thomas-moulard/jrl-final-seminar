  abstract = {In this paper we address a reconfiguration planning method for locomotion
	of a homogeneous modular robotic system and we conduct an experiment
	to verify that the planned locomotion can be realized by hardware.
	Our recently developed module is self-reconfigurable. A group of
	the modules can thus generate various three-dimensional robotic structures
	and motions. Although the module itself is a simple mechanism, self-reconfiguration
	planning for locomotion presents a computationally difficult problem
	due to the many combinatorial possibilities of modular configurations.
	In this paper, we develop a two-layered planning method for locomotion
	of a class of regular structures. This locomotion mode is based on
	multi-module blocks. The upper layer plans the overall cluster motion
	called flow to realize locomotion along a given desired trajectory;
	the lower layer determines locally cooperative module motions, called
	motion schemes, based on a rule database. A planning simulation demonstrates
	that this approach effectively solves the complicated planning problem.
	Besides the fundamental motion capacity of the module, the hardware
	feasibility of the planning locomotion is verified through a self-reconfiguration
	experiment using the prototype modules we have developed.},

  abstract = {An evolutionary motion synthesis method using genetic algorithm (GA)
	is presented for selfreconfigurable modular robot M-TRAN designed
	to realize various robotic motions and threedimensional structures.
	The proposed method is characterized by its capacity to derive feasible
	solutions for complex synthesis problem of M-TRAN through natural
	genetic representation. For this purpose, the behavior of the robot
	is described using a motion sequence including both the dynamic motions
	and configuration changes of the robot. It is a series of segments
	each of which can specify simultaneous motor actuations and self-reconfiguration
	by connection/disconnection, starting from a given initial configuration.
	This simple description can be straightforwardly encoded into genetic
	representation to which genetic operations can be applied in a natural
	manner. We adopt traveling distance achieved by the evolved motion
	as the fitness function of GA. To verify the effectiveness of the
	proposed method, we have conducted simulations of evolutionary motion
	synthesis for certain initial configurations. Consequently, we confirm
	various adaptive motions are acquired according to different initial
	configurations and fitness functions. We also verify the physical
	feasibility of the evolved motions through experiments using hardware
	module M-TRAN II.},

  abstract = {Pivoting has such advantages as dexterity and safety over such methods

	of pivoting is used by humans to move large and bulky furniture from

	pivoting using a humanoid platform towards dexterous whole-body manipulation.
	The robot should be able to pivot the object and to walk with it
	to displace it to a specific location. In this paper, an elementary
	whole-body motion of pivoting by a humanoid robot is studied. First,
	the object is manipulated by two arms of a humanoid robot using impedance
	control for grasping, together with body balancing control while
	the robot stays at the same place. Next, the movement of the humanoid
	robot itself is performed by stepping with the help of resolved momentum
	control (RMC) to guarantee the robot stability. The proposed manipulation
	method is validated through dynamic simulation and hardware experiment
	using the humanoid platform HRP-2.},

  abstract = {A Method for behavior planning is presented for a modular robot that
	applies a randomized planner to coherent structure of the robot.
	To cope with difficulty in planning of many degrees of freedom (DOFs)
	of a modular robot, we adopted Ågcoherent structureÅh in terms of control
	system and robot configuration. As the control system, a simple phase
	synchronization mechanism is introduced that can control the robot
	with many DOFs with reduced number of parameters. Together with coherency
	in configuration, which is symmetrical shape, this control system
	can generate various dynamic motions. To plan the behaviors of the
	modular robot determined by the parameters of the control system,
	we adopt a randomized planner called rapidly exploring random trees
	(RRTs). This can benefit from a number of advantages of RRT planner,
	including simple implementation, uniform search, and applicability
	to a dynamic system with differential constraints. By exploring parameter
	space of the coherent control system, behaviors including dynamic
	motions can be planned. We have applied the proposed planner to MTRAN
	modular robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
	through preliminary simulation results.},

  abstract = {Pivoting manipulation can be an alternative to pushing operation when
	the floor is not flat enough, or when the object to manipulate is
	too heavy. The technique of pivoting is used by humans to move large
	and bulky furniture from one place to another. The decomposition
	of the task of pivoting has already been studied, in particular with
	the use of two fingers of a robotic arm. This work intends to apply
	the technique of pivoting using an humanoid platform. The robot should
	be able to pivot the object and to walk with it to displace it to
	a specific remote location. The research achievements proposed here
	take place in a more long term objective aimed at improving the dexterity
	and the autonomy of humanoid robots. As a matter of fact, such robots
	should be able to handle objects and move around in the environment
	in an autonomous way. This paper describes the algorithm designed
	to perform the displacement of a large object using the pivoting
	technique. It also presents the results of the dynamic simulation
	of the HRP-2 platform performing the task.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address a task-driven motion generation method that
	allows a humanoid robot to make whole-body motions including support
	polygon reshaping to achieve the given tasks. In the proposed method,
	generalized inverse kinematics (IK) is employed with floating-base
	to generate humanoid whole-body motions that enable the robot to
	accomplish the tasks according to given priorities. During the motion,
	several criteria such as manipulability or end-effector position
	error are tracked. If the desired task cannot be done because of
	those criteria, a geometric planner for support polygon is activated.
	Then the whole-body motion is computed again always using the generalized
	IK solver including stepping motion that realizes the deformed support
	polygon by using dynamic walking pattern generator. This method provides
	a way to perform tasks that could not be done without changing the
	humanoidÅfs support state. We have verified the proposed framework
	through simulations and experiments using humanoid robot HRP-2.}

  abstract = {Pivoting manipulation has such advantages as dexterity and safety
	over other methods to move bulky or heavy objects. In this paper
	we aim to show that a polyhedral object can be displaced to arbitrary
	position and orientation on a plane (i.e. such a pivoting system
	is controllable). More than that we show it is small time controllable,
	i.e. the reachable space from a starting point contains always a
	neighbor no matter how cluttered the environment is. As a consequence
	of this analysis, we propose a steering method to plan a manipulation
	path to be performed by a humanoid robot: first we use a classical
	nonholonomic path planner that accounts for the robot motion constraints,
	then we transform that path into a sequence of pivoting operations.
	While the feasibility of elementary pivoting tasks has been already
	experienced by the humanoid robot HRP-2, we present here the very
	first simulations of the plans generated by our steering method.}
