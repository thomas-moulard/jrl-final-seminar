  abstract = {Self-reconfigurable modular robotic system has been attracting many
	researchers for its versatility. The capabilities such as self-reconfiguration
	and locomotion in various configurations enable adaptation to the
	environment and given tasks. Considering a practical use of such
	modular robotic systems, locomotion capability is considered as a
	most essential function. There are two types of locomotion utilized
	for modular robots; one type is realized by repeating self-reconfiguration
	and the other is realized as a whole body motion such as walking
	and crawling. Even for the latter type of locomotion, designing control
	method is more difficult than ordinary robots. This is because configurations
	made by modules are a multi-degree of freedom system and there are
	a wide variety of possible configurations. In this paper we address
	the latter type of locomotion for modular robots and propose an offline
	method to generate a locomotion pattern automatically suited for
	a given module configuration. The proposed method utilizes a neural
	oscillator as a controller of the joint motor and evolutionary computation
	method for optimization of the neural oscillator network, which determines
	the pattern of locomotion. We confirm the validity of the method
	by software simulation and hardware experiments. We also show experiments

	system on the HRP-2 humanoid, for learning a cooperative assembly
	task. We previously defined a system for Spoken Language Programming
	(SLP) that allowed the user to guide the robot through an arbitrary,
	task relevant, motor sequence via spoken commands, and to store this
	sequence as re-usable macro. Here we significantly extend the SLP
	system: It integrates vision and motion planning into the SLP framework,
	providing a new level of flexibility in the actions that can be created,
	and it allows the user to create "generic" functions with arguments
	(e.g. Give me X), and it allows multiple functions to be created},

	that are the shortest in distance in free spaces. The footprints

  abstract = {A modular robot has a distributed mechanical composition which can
	make various configurations and also
	
	make locomotion in a wide variety of configurations. Modular robots
	are thought to be useful in extreme or
	
	unknown environments by adaptively changing their shape and locomotion
	patterns. As for locomotion, two types can be
	
	used; one is whole-body fixed-configuration locomotion and the other
	is locomotion by self-reconfiguration. In this paper
	
	we deal with the former type of locomotion where module configurations
	are fixed and locomotion is realized by
	
	coordinated joint actuation. So far, proposed control methods for
	whole-body locomotion by modular robots have
	
	been based on predefined locomotion sequences. However, locomotion
	based on predefined sequences cannot adapt to
	
	changing terrain conditions such as uphill, downhill, slippery and
	sticky grounds. To solve such problems, we apply a
	
	distributed control mechanism using a CPG controller to realize adaptive
	locomotion by modular robots. Besides the
	
	CPG control we introduce an additional control mechanism for detecting
	the situation that the robot is stuck and
	
	initiating transformation. The results of hardware experiments by
	4-legged structure prove the feasibility of the
	
	method for adaptive locomotion and transformation by our M-TRAN II

	The learned sequences should function as executable procedures that
	can operate in a flexible manner that are not rigidly sensitive to
	initial conditions. The current research develops these capabilities
	in a real-time control system for the HRP-2 humanoid. The task domain
	involves a human and the HRP-2 working together to assemble a piece
	of furniture. We previously defined a system for Spoken Language
	Programming (SLP) that allowed the user to guide the robot through
	an arbitrary, task relevant, motor sequence via spoken commands,
	and to store this sequence as re-usable macro. The current research
	significantly extends the SPL system: It integrates vision and motion
	planning into the SLP framework, providing a new level of flexibility
	in the behavior that can be created. Most important it allows the
	user to create "generic" functions with arguments (e.g. Give me X),
	and it allows multiple functions to be created. We thus demonstrate
	- for the first time - a humanoid robot equipped with vision based
	grasping, and the ability to acquire multiple sensory motor behavioral
	procedures in real-time through SLP in the context of a cooperative
	task. The humanoid robot thus acquires new sensory motor skills that

  abstract = {The approximation of humanoid robot by an inverted pendulum is one
	of the most used model to generate a stable walking motion using
	a planned Zero Moment Point (ZMP) trajectory. Many studies have been
	carried out to improve the reliability of this model. One of the
	proposed models is the quadratic system model, which has been validated
	by conducting real experiments on the humanoid robot. In this paper,
	we propose several controlling algorithms for the quadratic system.
	Some of these algorithms are devoted for on-line walking pattern
	generation and the others for off-line walking pattern generation
	for the humanoid robot. In order to validate these algorithms dynamically
	stable walking patterns have been generated. The stability and feasibility
	of walking patterns have been confirmed using dynamical simulation
	and conducting real experiments on the humanoid robot HRP-4C.},

	replanning scheme and architecture for humanoid robot reactive walking.
	Based on a dense set of actions, our approach uses a large panel
	of the humanoid robot capabilities and is particularly well suited
	for 3D collision avoidance. Indeed A-* approaches becomes difficult
	in such situation, thus the method demonstrated here relies on RRT.
	Combined with an approximation of the volume swept by the robot legs
	while walking, our method is able to cope with 3D obstacles while
	maintaining real-time computation. We experimentally validate our
	approach on the robot HRP-2.},

	energy consumption when constraints translating impairments are added,
