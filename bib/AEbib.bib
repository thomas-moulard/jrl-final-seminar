  abstract = {This paper presents work from an ongoing project towards developing
	a new generation of virtual human models that are highly realistic
	in appearance, movement, and feedback. Santosï¿½, an anatomically
	correct human model with more than 100 degrees of freedom, is an
	avatar that exhibits extensive modelling and simulation capabilities,
	resides in a virtual environment, and conducts human-factors analysis.
	The paper presents an optimisation-based approach to posture and
	motion prediction that allows the avatar to operate with autonomy
	rather than depending on stored animations and data or being restricted
	by inverse kinematics. It also presents approaches to determining
	reach envelopes and workspace zone differentiation, and discusses
	methods for evaluating the physiological status of the virtual human
	as it completes tasks. Muscle modelling including muscle wrapping,
	muscle force and stress determination is also discussed. Finally,
	the process of building a 25-DOF hand model is described. The result
	is an exciting step towards a virtual human that is more extensive
	and complete than any other.},

	Nonlinear equality constraints are turned into inequality constraints

	in general, the distance between two circles is an algebraic function
	of the parameters defining them, but that this function is not solvable
	in terms of radicals. Although this result implies that one cannot
	find a "closed-form" solution for the distance between an arbitrary
	pair of circles in R^3 , we discuss how such an algebraic quantity
	can still be manipulated symbolically by combining standard polynomial
	operations with an algorithm for isolating the real roots of a polynomial
	in a convenient data structure for real algebraic numbers. This data
	structure and its operations have been implemented.},

	important function for developing sensor based behaviors without
	worrying about breaking hardware. In this paper, we propose a practical
	and real-time self collision detection system for humanoid robots
	that satisfy both enough a range of movement and a safety margin.
	Previous researches usually add a safety margin around each link
	to cope with errors in both modeling and control. However this margin
	significantly decreases a range of movement of a joint, especially
	a compound joint, a joint between adjacent links and composed of
	2 or 3 revolute joints whose axis intersect in a same point In order
	to gain enough a range of movement and safety margin, we developed
	hybrid approach that uses both table based collision checking for
	compound joints and online geometrical model checking with a simplified
	link shape for other joints We have experimentally evaluated our
	self collision detection system using a HRP2-JSK humanoid robot.
	Our demonstration shows that the robot automatically stops its motion
	when self collision occurs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel high-precision algorithm for the calculation
	of the minimal distance between two circles in three dimensions.
	Contrary to the common approach that mainly utilizes a solution of
	an eighth-degree polynomial equation, the proposed algorithm is based
	on directly using the distance function and its derivatives. As the
	theory is not too complicated, the algorithm is very easy to implement.
	The paper also suggests a small modification of the circle-circle
	distance algorithm for the circle-line distance calculation. Results
	of computational simulation compared with Eberly's Wild Magic library
	are given and summarized in detail at the end of the paper. They
	show that the proposed algorithm always correctly finds the global
	minimum with much higher accuracy at the same speed in the circle-circle
	distance calculation case, whereas circle-line calculation is approximately
	four times faster. The source code is available online at the web
	site given at the end of this paper.},
