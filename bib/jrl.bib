  abstract = {We present a planner for underactuated hyper-redundant robots, such
	as humanoid robots, for which the movement can only be initiated
	by taking contacts with the environment. We synthesize our previous
	work on the subject and go further into details to give an in-depth
	description of the contact planning problem and the mechanisms of
	our contact planner. We highlight the structure of the problem with
	a simple example, present the contact space and the heuristics we
	use for planning, and explain thoroughly the implementation of the
	different parts of the planner. Finally we give examples of planning
	results for complex scenarios with the humanoid robot HRP-2.},

  abstract = {The most widely used technique for generating whole-body motions on
	a humanoid robot accounting for various tasks and constraints is
	inverse kinematics. Based on the task-function approach, this class
	of methods enables the coordination of robot movements to execute
	several tasks in parallel and account for the sensor feedback in
	real time, thanks to the low computation cost. To some extent, it
	also enables us to deal with some of the robot constraints (e.g.,
	joint limits or visibility) and manage the quasi-static balance of
	the robot. In order to fully use the whole range of possible motions,
	this paper proposes extending the task-function approach to handle
	the full dynamics of the robot multi-body along with any constraint
	written as equality or inequality of the state and control variables.
	The definition of multiple objectives is made possible by ordering
	them inside a strict hierarchy. Several models of contact with the
	environment can be implemented in the framework. We propose a reduced
	formulation of the multiple rigid planar contact that keeps a low
	computation cost. The efficiency of this approach is illustrated
	by presenting several multi-contact dynamic motions in simulation
	and on the real HRP-2 robot.},

	for teaching a robot to physically interact with a human in a collaborative

	task model allows the robot to anticipate the partner's intentions
	and adapt its motion according to perceived forces. As the human
	represents a highly complex contact environment, direct reproduction

	for unmodelled uncertainties, in addition to learning we propose
	an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the impedance parameters,

  abstract = {An original method to build a visual model for unknown objects by
	a humanoid robot is proposed. The algorithm ensures successful autonomous
	realization of this goal by addressing the problem as an active coupling
	between computer vision and whole-body posture generation. The visual
	model is built through the repeated execution of two processes. The
	first one considers the current knowledge about the visual aspects
	and shape of the object to deduce a preferred viewpoint with the
	aim of reducing the uncertainty of the shape and appearance of the
	object. This is done while considering the constraints related to
	the embodiment of the vision sensors in the humanoid head. The second
	process generates a whole robot posture using the desired head pose
	while solving additional constraints such as collision avoidance
	and joint limitations. The main contribution of our approach relies
	on the use of different optimization algorithms to find an optimal
	viewpoint by including the humanoid specificities in terms of constraints,
	an embedded vision sensor, and redundant motion capabilities. This
	approach differs significantly from those of traditional works addressing
	the problem of autonomously building an object model.},
